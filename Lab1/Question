7. Bank Account System
Consider a simple bank account system where you have customers and their
bank accounts. Each customer has a name, and a unique identifier, and can have
one or more bank accounts. Each bank account has an account number, and a
balance, and belongs to a specific customer.
Design a set of Java classes to model this bank account system. Your
implementation should include the following features:
Customer Class:
Attributes: name, customerID, bankAccount
Methods: getters and setters, a method to add a bank account, a method to
display customer information, methods to deposit and withdraw money
BankAccount Class:

Attributes: accountNumber, balance
Methods: getters and setters, a method to deposit money, a method to withdraw
money, and a method to display account information.
Create customer and bank-account objects.
And only using the customer object, to deposit or withdraw money.
